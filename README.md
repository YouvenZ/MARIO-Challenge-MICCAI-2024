## Context

This is the github page of the MARIO challenge. This page aims to provide guidance of how to publish your solution to grand-challenge.

We provide the following information

- The script we used for the evaluation
- A docker exemple for the submission for final phase

## Tasks

### Task 1 

The first task focuses on pairs of 2D slices (B-scans) from two consecutive OCT acquisitions. The goal is to classify the evolution between these two slices (before and after), which clinicians typically examine side by side on their screens.

### Task 2

The second task focuses on 2D slices level. The goal is to predict the future evolution within 3 months with close monitoring of patients that are enrolled in an anti-VEGF treatments plan. In summary, the first task aims to automate the initial step of the analysis (useful for decision support) and the second task aims to automate the complete analysis process (useful for autonomous AI).
