## Instructions for Completing Each Section

### 1. **Team and Participant Information**
   - **Objective:** Enter your team's details and the main contributors to this submission.
   - **Instructions:**
     - Fill out each column with your **Team Name**, **Contributor Names** (maximum of 5 for top-ranked teams, otherwise up to 3), **Institution(s)**, and a **GitHub Link** to your project repository (if applicable).
     - List contributor names with the correct affiliation, indicated by superscript numbers if multiple institutions are represented.

### 2. **Task 1: Method Summary**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the core methods used for Task 1.
   - **Instructions:**
     - Describe each method and configuration used in this task. This includes **Preprocessing** steps, **Model Architecture** (e.g., type of encoder), **Loss Function**, **Post-processing** techniques, **Data Augmentation**, **Inference Time (GPU)**, **Model Parameters**, and the **Framework** used.
     - Keep descriptions brief but specific to convey your method‚Äôs structure clearly.

### 3. **Task 1: Methodology Components**
   - **Objective:** Identify whether specific components were used in Task 1.
   - **Instructions:**
     - For each item (e.g., **Pretext Task**, **Foundation Model**), indicate "Y" for Yes or "N" for No.
     - If the item was used, include the specific component name (e.g., "Y / Masked Autoencoder"). If it was not used, simply indicate "N."

### 4. **Task 2: Method Summary**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the core methods used for Task 2.
   - **Instructions:** Follow the same guidelines as for Task 1, filling in details specific to the methods, architecture, and configurations used for Task 2.

### 5. **Task 2: Methodology Components**
   - **Objective:** Identify whether specific components were used in Task 2.
   - **Instructions:** Complete as in Task 1's Methodology Components section, indicating whether each component was used and, if so, naming it.

### 6. **Team Approach Summaries**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the methods, models, and unique approaches your team developed.
   - **Instructions:**
 Provide an overview of your methodology, explaining core design choices, preprocessing steps, data handling, and any unique strategies used to improve performance or address specific challenges.  Summarize your approach to Task 2, noting any adjustments or new techniques used to address differences between tasks.
     - Include any additional remarks about model tuning, special architectures, or custom data processing that significantly impacted performance.
     - **Code Link:** If you have a GitHub repository with your code, include the link in this section if not already provided.
